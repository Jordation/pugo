# Why

There's a lot of discord bots out there that run a basic 10 man game but are either bloated and slow or lacking in any sort of meaningful configuration options.

With pugo, I am aiming to build out a scalable system for managing multiple concurrent queues per server while still allowing each server to customize the bot to its own needs.

I've played a lot of high level pugs in my time gaming and know how much it can benefit a community while also seeing many times how servers offering a similar environment can and have failed in the past as a result of the system not being engaging enough, or lacking the ability to modify it to suit more specific needs.
